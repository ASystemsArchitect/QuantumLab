# QuantumLab
This is my project for the numerical methods course I'm seeing.

I want to include:
- Checking whether a given function is an actual wave function
- The general numerical simulation and graph for some given wave function into a finite interval
- A "paper" which describes the numerical solution for the probability distribution for a wave function in a closed interval
